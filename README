To use the SDL2 libraries with freePascal, copy the contents of the ~/gits/SDL2... directory to your game directory structure somewhere.

My dir structure:
/root-game-folder
    sdl2/

Compile with:
fpc -Fusdl2 program_name.bas

I use vim and vim-plug. Possibly useful vim-plug tools:

Plug 'vim-airline/vim-airline'
Plug 'vim-scripts/paredit.vim'
Plug 'tpope/vim-sensible'
Plug 'vim-scripts/fpc.vim'

}

Any editor will do.  Visual Studio Code works well too.
