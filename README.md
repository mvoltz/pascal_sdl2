I'm learning pascal with FreePascal and SDL2

https://freepascal.org/
https://github.com/PascalGameDevelopment/SDL2-for-Pascal.git

I'm following the tutorial from https://www.freepascal-meets-sdl.net/

Compile files with:
fpc -Fusdl2 program_name.bas

I use vim and vim-plug. Possibly useful vim-plug tools:

Plug 'vim-airline/vim-airline'
Plug 'vim-scripts/paredit.vim'
Plug 'tpope/vim-sensible'
Plug 'vim-scripts/fpc.vim'
